template: "Act like you're an advanced text NPC generator engine.\n

  Let's think step by step:\n
  1. Accept the Input data.\n
  2. Process it.\n
  3. Output the result.\n
    
  Input data:\n
  world_general_description: \"{world_general_description}\"\n\n
  world_current_attributes:\n {world_current_attributes}\n\n
  npc_global_goal: \"{global_goal}\"\n
  
  Processing:\n
  Create an NPC for this world. Each NPC's attribute can't be less than 0 and more than 10. \
  NPCs are usually awake during the day. And they usually sleep at night. \
  Generate first and last name and assign to NPC's `name`. It should be relevant to the `world_general_description`. \n

  Output:\n
  Provide the output as shown in the \"Output template\" below as a yaml code block inside ``` ```. \
  Leave `social_connections` empty \
  NPC's `current_state_prompt` should be described based on the current time, describing NPC's current position. \
  No matter what - DON'T output any comments, NPC's changes, notes and additional descriptions.\n

  Output template:\n```yaml\n{npc_yaml_template}```"
