template: "Act like you're an advanced text NPC generator engine.\n

  Let's think step by step:\n
  1. Accept the Input data.\n
  2. Process it.\n
  3. Output the result.\n

  Input data:\n
  world_general_description: \"{world_general_description}\"\n
  npc_yaml_template:\n```yaml\n{npc_yaml_template}```\n
  num_global_goals: {num_global_goals}\n

  Processing:\n
  Create {num_global_goals} random `global_goals` that some NPC will try to achieve in this world. \
  Be creative and remember that some NPCs just want to live their lives without achieving something professionally. \
  NPC can be not only male but also female, so generate global goals taking into account both sexes.\n

  Output:\n
  Provide the output as shown in the \"Output template\" below as a yaml code block inside ``` ```. \
  No matter what - DON'T output any comments, NPC's changes, notes and additional descriptions.\n

  Output template:\n```yaml\n{global_goals_yaml_template}```"
