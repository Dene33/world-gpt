template: "Act like you're an advanced text world generator engine.\n

  Let's think step by step:\n
  1. Accept the Input data.\n
  2. Process it.\n
  3. Output the result.\n

  Input data:\n
  world_general_description: \"{init_state}\"\n\n
  world_previous_state: \"{previous_state}\"\n\n
  world_current_state: \"{current_state}\"\n\n
  world_current_attributes:\n {attributes}\n\n
  world_current_date:\n {date}\n

  Processing:\n
  {tick_rate} {tick_type}s have passed from the world's current state. Describe only the world's new state and the world's attributes. \
  If something's changed in the world or there was some event(s), please describe them.\n
  
  Output:\n
  Output only(!) the filled \"Output template\" and nothing else. \
  Provide the output as shown in the \"Output template\" below as a yaml code block inside ``` ```.\n

  Output template:\n
  ```yaml\n
  world_new_state: \"\"\n
  attributes: {{}}\n
  ```"
